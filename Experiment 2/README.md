# Experiment 2
## Basics of Python

### Aim :  
To study the Python programming environment and interface, understand execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations in Python.  

### Tools Used :  
* Google Colab
* Python 3
* Github

### Theory  
We understood when and why Python must be used and how we can use it to our advantage.  
We learnt following features of basic Python programming to help us be more proficient.  

### 1. Python Environment and Interface
The Python environment provides tools and interfaces to write, execute, and debug Python programs. Python programs can be executed using different interfaces such as:
- Python Shell  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code  
- Cloud-based platforms like Google Colab  

These interfaces allow users to write code, execute instructions, and view results interactively.

### 2. Python Execution Modes

#### a) Interactive Mode
- Commands are executed one line at a time  
- Immediate output is displayed  
- Useful for testing small code snippets and learning  
- Examples include Python Shell, Jupyter Notebook cells, and Google Colab  

#### b) Script Mode
- Programs are written in a file and executed as a whole  
- Suitable for developing complete applications  
- Files usually have a `.py` extension

### 3. Comments in Python
Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability.

- Single-line comments begin with `#`  
- Multi-line comments are written using triple quotes (`""" """`)  

Comments help in documentation and understanding program logic.

---

### 4. Variables and Identifiers
A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.

#### Rules for Identifiers
- Must start with a letter (A–Z or a–z) or underscore `_`  
- Cannot start with a digit  
- Case-sensitive  
- Should not use Python keywords  

Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables do not require explicit data type declaration.

### 5. Data Types in Python
Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data.

#### Basic Data Types
- Integer (`int`): Whole numbers  
- Floating-point (`float`): Decimal numbers  
- String (`str`): Sequence of characters  
- Boolean (`bool`): True or False  

The data type of a variable can be identified using the `type()` function.

---

### 6. Operators and Expressions
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

#### Types of Operators
- Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
- Relational Operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`  
- Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`  
- Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`  
- Bitwise Operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`  

An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.

---

### 7. Basic Input and Output Operations
Input and output operations allow interaction between the user and the program.

#### Input
- The `input()` function is used to accept input from the user  
- Input is treated as a string by default and may require type conversion  

#### Output
- The `print()` function is used to display output  
- Formatted output can be achieved using commas or formatted strings

### Conclusion :  
We learnt to use Python for programming and understood implmentation of it's versatile features. Python is incredibly helpful for Exploratory Data Analysis and is essential foundation for Data Science stream, hence we learnt to take benefit of it.
