# Operations on Tuple
## A Python tuple is an ordered and immutable collection of elements, meaning its contents cannot be changed after it is created. Tuples are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses () and separating them with commas.  

### Aim : To learn Python List operations for various tasks   

### Tools Used :  
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Nootebook
- Git
- GitHub
- VSCode  

### Theory  
In Python, a tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items.  
A tuple stores multiple values in a single variable, like a list, but you can’t change it after it’s created.

**Key characteristics**
- Ordered → items have a fixed position (index-based)
- Immutable → you can’t add, remove, or change elements
- Allows duplicates
- Can hold mixed data types  

**Features of Tuples**
- Once created, elements of a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed.
- Ordered
- Elements have a fixed order and can be accessed using indexing.
- Allows Duplicate Values
- Tuples can contain repeated elements.
- Heterogeneous
- A tuple can store elements of different data types (int, float, string, etc.).
- Faster than Lists
- Tuples are more memory-efficient and faster to access than lists.
- Tuples can contain other tuples or collections.  

### Conclusion  

In conclusion, operations on tuples allow efficient access and handling of fixed data while preserving immutability. Despite being unchangeable, tuple operations make them useful, reliable, and suitable for read-only data in Python programs.
